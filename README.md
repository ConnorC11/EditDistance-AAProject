# Minimum Edit Distance - Advanced Algorithms Project
**Description** : \
The objective of this project is to implement some algorithms for computing the Edit distance (ED) 
(an adaptation of the LCS problem) and to provide an experimental study of their running time and 
the quality of the solution given.
